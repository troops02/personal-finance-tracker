A great project idea that leverages the concepts you've learned is a Personal Finance Tracker. Here's what it could include:

Features:
Add Transactions: Allow users to input transactions with descriptions, amounts, and dates.
Categorize Transactions: Include categories like Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.
Track Balances: Show total income, expenses, and net balance.
Sort and Filter: Enable sorting by date, amount, or category, and filtering transactions by date range.
Currency Conversion: Use the Intl object for formatting amounts in different currencies.
Budget Reminders: Set a budget and alert users when they are close to exceeding it using timers and DOM events.

Additional Stretch Goals:
Responsive Design: Make it mobile-friendly using basic CSS.
Export Data: Allow users to export their transactions as a CSV file.
Charts and Graphs: Use libraries like Chart.js to visualize income vs. expenses.
This project will challenge you to integrate multiple concepts while creating something practical! Let me know if you'd like detailed guidance on any part of it.
